His work has often divided critics, but none has been as controversial as Vault.<br><br>Dubbed the `Yellow Peril' by Councillor Osborne, the yellow metal sculpture caused a storm of protest over its suitability for City Square. Ironically, it was commissioned for its compatibility with the square's design. The winner of a competition organised by the square's architects, Robertson-Swann's design met the challenge of being a `grand interlocked sculpture'. It also met the requirement of being bold, visually simple and a strong focal point, which would offset the formal character of the square. But while Vault met these objectives, it was a little too abstract for public taste.<br><br>Professor Patrick McCaughey gave his full support to the work, applauding it for design excellence.

When the sculpture was installed it was yet to be named, and despite Robertson-Swann soon naming it Vault, Yellow Peril, with its racist overtones, has stuck. <br><br>Following its installation in 1980, Councillor Osborne tabled a survey showing Melburnians' lack of support for the sculpture's prominent position, based on the opinion that it was not sympathetic to the nearby historic St Paul's Cathedral and Town Hall.

Water is sprayed from the top and from surrounding ornaments into a large basin. But this scene of innocence was created in a far less naive setting. <br><br>Stanford was apprenticed to a London stonemason before coming to Australia to try his luck on the Bendigo goldfields. When he failed to make his fortune, he turned to horse stealing, and in 1854 was imprisoned for 10 years. He was released after six on ticket-of-leave, but was soon found guilty on two charges of highway robbery and another of horse stealing. The sentences amounted to a total of 22 years, two of which were served as hard labour in irons after Stanford broke out of a supposedly `escape-proof' gaol in 1861. In Melbourne's Pentridge Prison, Stanford's talent for drawing and carving was recognised ' he carved bones left over from stews ' and the prison governor allowed him to turn his hand to carving stone. Local sculptor Charles Summers tutored Stanford, who soon set to carving a fountain from bluestone from the prison quarry, which was the only material available to him. He modelled the fountain's avian adornments on a stuffed eagle-hawk and modelled the boy on the governor's son.   <br><br>The fountain was installed in Carpentaria Place (now known as Gordon Reserve) in 1871, following Stanford's release after he and his friends petitioned for this on the grounds of his ill health. The Illustrated Australian News claimed the fountain was `not only a work of great beauty but ... executed under circumstances of extreme difficulty [which for] most men would have been insurmountable'. Stanford received no payment for the fountain but in time became a respected citizen; he established a business in Windsor, which had a reputation for creating fine headstones. Stanford died in 1880 from `stonemasons' disease', having inhaled a surfeit of fine dust while creating his beautiful fountain.<br>",Fountain,c1870,"STANFORD FOUNTAIN / ERECTED 1871 / THIS FOUNTAIN OF VICTORIAN BASALT WAS DESIGNED, / SCULPTED AND / ERECTED BY WILLIAM STANFORD OF ST KILDA",-37.81243425403014,City of Melbourne,Parks Services Branch,"Stanford, William",Gordon Reserve,Sculpture,Stanford Fountain

Between 1904 and 1906 she studied sculpture with Edouard Lanteri at the Royal College of Art, London. On her return to Australia, she quickly became the country's most acclaimed woman sculptor and was responsible for a number of major civic memorials in Melbourne and in rural towns, including Sir Thomas Bent (Brighton), and war memorials at Alexandra and Maryborough.

In 1907, she was posted in Brussels to assist in establishing a modern nursing system at the Berkendael Medical Institute. At the outbreak of World War One she was left in charge of the hospital and what is now known as the Red Cross. During that time she assisted more than 200 Belgian, British and French soldiers who had been separated from their armies, or who had escaped German detention. In 1915, she was accused of conspiring to help prisoners escape, and was tried by a military court in Brussels. She was convicted and sentenced to death, along with four others. Cavell was executed by firing squad on 12 October 1915; she was still wearing her nurse's uniform. Her last words feature on one of the memorial's plaques: `I know now that patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred and no bitterness towards anyone.' Cavell's body was returned to England in 1919, where a full military service was conducted at Westminster Abbey.<br><br>The appeal for funds for a Cavell memorial garnered such support in Australia that much of the money was devoted to assisting incapacitated war nurses.

The statue was originally located on the west side of St Kilda Road where Sir John Madden, Lieutenant Governor, unveiled the statue on 23 January 1904. The statue was moved to its current site in the Treasury Gardens in 1970 due to a change in the profile of St Kilda Rd with both the developments of the NGV and the Victorian College of the Arts occurring in the area.

His importance is immense, not only in terms of his work, but for his influence on the poetry and culture of Scotland. Robert Burns was born on 25th January 1759, in the tiny village of Alloway, Ayrshire, near Ayr on the West Coast of Scotland. The son of a poor peasant farmer, Burns grew up in abject poverty and was forced labour long hours throughout his childhood.  Despite their poverty Burns'''''''' father recognised the value of education and contracted the services of local teacher, John Murdoch.  From an early age it was apparent that Burns was a gifted scholar, writing his first piece Handsome Nell (a poem about his first love and the first of many odes to women) at the age of 15. Unlucky in love Burns resolved to emigrate to the West Indies, intending to pay for his passage with the proceeds from the publication of his first book, Poems, Chiefly in Scottish Dialect, published in 1786. The publication immediately captured the hearts of the Scottish public and was considered to be one of the greatest collections of poetry ever written. Enjoying his new found celebrity, Burns began to write profusely publishing many poems, among them perhaps his most famous piece Auld Lang Syne. Burns'''''''' appeal was universal; his words resonated with the ruling class, the educated and the common folk alike.  Love and sympathy were his greatest themes and he often paid tribute to the working class in his works. Burns died in extreme poverty of rheumatic fever in 1796 at the age of 37.<br>",Statue,1903,Bronze base right: G.

On the statue is the inscription, ""This is the place for a village.""<br><br>Born in Parramatta, New South Wales, in 1801, John Batman is best known as one of Melbourne's founding fathers. The son of a cutler transported for receiving stolen goods, Batman was apprenticed as a blacksmith and later became a farmer. He took up land in North- eastern Tasmania where he prospered and his holdings were further augmented by a government reward for his role in the conciliation of disputes with Indigenous Tasmanians. Looking to expand his grazing land he organised an unofficial expedition to explore Victoria and in May 1835 Batman crossed to the mainland in the Rebecca. In June he was one of an exploring party which walked north from the western end of Port Phillip to near Mount Macedon, then east to Glenburn, and south-west back to the Yarra. Upon finding these lands agreeable he made a controversial treaty with local Wurundjeri Elders, exchanging 20 pairs of blankets, 30 tomahawks, 100 knives, 50 scissors, 30 mirrors, 200 handkerchiefs, 45.4 kg of flour, 6 shirts, 4 jackets and 4 suits, together with an annual rent in the same commodities for 600 000 acres of land along the Bellarine Peninsula. The government of the time soon declared the treaty invalid, claiming the 'Crown' as the true owner of the land. The treaty was also seen to be fraudulent. The signatories were not `chiefs' and the boundaries were not marked. Most importantly, the land belonged to tribes, not individuals, and so was inalienable. An exchange of gifts had been misconstrued as a sale.  Soon after signing the treaty Batman sailed up the Yarra past the present site of Melbourne and made the famous entry in his diary, ""This will be the place for a village.' However, on his return to Victoria some months later he found Fawkner already settled on the present site of Melbourne. With his health declining, Batman settled on Batman's Hill near the present site of the Spencer Street Railway Station and died of syphilis just four years later on the 6 May 1839 at the age of 38.  <br>",Sculpture,1978,John Batman 1801-1839 This is the place for a village,-37.81765977602296,City of Melbourne,Arts & Culture Branch,"Hammond, Stanley 1913 - 2000",,Sculpture,John Batman Memorial [2]

In 1915 a public subscriptions began, however with the coming of war the plans were put on hold. In 1922 the notion was resurrected, this time by the Melbourne City Council, and C. Web Gilbert was elected to create the piece. In subsequent months there was much factional fighting and public debate about the location and the form of the sculpture. There was heavy competition for the statue to be placed at the St Kilda foreshore, but a Council meeting decided in 1923 that it ""must be located within the city of Melbourne."" Finally in 1924 a design was approved and permission was granted by St Paul''''''''''''''''s Cathedral to house the statue on their grounds. The bronze statue itself was cast in Paris by Barbedienne, and sadly Gilbert died just days before it returned to Melbourne. It was unveiled by the Governor, Lord Stradbroke on November 7 1925, in the presence of more than 3000 people. <br><br>Flinders gained acclaim for establishing the strait between mainland Australia and Tasmania in 1798.

Accordingly, this work by Indigenous artists Vicki Couzens (Kirrae Wurrong/Gunditjmara), Lee Darroch (Yorta Yorta, Mutti Mutti and Trawlwoolway) and Treahna Hamm (Yorta Yorta) honours the traditions of tribes throughout Victoria, particularly those of the Wurundjeri and Boonwurrung, on whose country the city and greater Melbourne is located.

The carved hardwood message sticks stand at the site's eastern and western ends, representing the Wurundjeri/Woiwurrung and Boonwurrung people, respectively, and welcoming visitors onto the site in a gesture of reconciliation. The eel path refers to a primary food source, trapped as they were near the shallow waterfalls that once separated the freshwater river from the salty bay water, not far from this site. The five large metal shields along the riverfront stand in complementary opposition to the feminine form of the mound campsite. On the southern side of the ArtPlay building, etched-metal panels, resembling possum-skin cloaks, interpret each element of Birrarung Wilam and are augmented by a sound installation of Indigenous voices.

It was originally a one-hectare, heavily treed area at the western tip of Flinders Park, where orators voiced opinion and dissent from nine bluestone-faced granite mounds (probably built in the 20th century). The site was most attended during periods of upheaval and struggle, such as during World War I, the Depression and the 1940s, when leftist politics were beginning to feel the force of repression.

The size of each bell determines its pitch, and collectively the pitch ranges over four octaves.<br><br>Most of the bells are harmonic and very pure in their tone; seven are polytonal, so able to play more than one pitch with a single hammer strike. Unlike most modern Western instruments, the bells are `just tuned', a system that follows a harmonic series in nature and means the bells emit a unique sound; music created for the bells must be composed with this system in mind.<br><br>Seven Australian composers were commissioned to create pieces of four to five minutes for the launch of the bells. Computer-controlled hammers strike the bells to the tune of the programmed compositions. In 2008, the City of Melbourne launched a website (www.federationbells.com.au) to allow members of the public to compose their own pieces for the bells. By walking among the bells or listening to them from up to 100 metres away, visitors have different aural experiences of the music. Eminent scientist and Australian of the Year (2000) Sir Gustav Nossal launched the Federation Bells installation on 26 January 2002. In 2005, the poles underwent a structural upgrade to ensure the longevity of the work.",Sculpture,2002,,-37.8186665820053,City of Melbourne,,"McLachlan, Neil; Hasell, Anton",Birrarung Marr,Sculpture,Federation Bells
